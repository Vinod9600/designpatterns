package structural.decorator;

/**
 *Decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting
 * the behavior of other existing objects within the same class. We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class.
 * This takes place at compile-time, and all the instances of that class get the extended behavior.
 *
 *     Decorator patterns allow a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
 *     So,there is no change to the original class.
 *     The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern, which provides a wrapper to the existing class.
 *     The decorator design pattern uses abstract classes or interfaces with the composition to implement the wrapper.
 *     Decorator design patterns create decorator classes, which wrap the original class
 *     and supply additional functionality by keeping the class methodsâ€™ signature unchanged.
 *     Decorator design patterns are most frequently used for applying single responsibility principles since
 *     we divide the functionality into classes with unique areas of concern.
 *     The decorator design pattern is structurally almost like the chain of responsibility pattern.
